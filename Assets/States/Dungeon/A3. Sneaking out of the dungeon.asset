    A3. Sneaking out of the dungeon

    

    You got the key
    and open the dungeon door. As sneaky as you could you look around and see the
    guards sleeping on the left, the door to the wine cellar, stairs going somewhere
    upstairs and perhaps a chance to lead to escaping.

    

    1. Go to wine
    cellar due to having an alcohol addiction

    2. Go up to the stairs and see
    what you can find there
